Dormify is a platform specifically marketed towards college students to buy and sell used items you typically find in a dorm such as appliances, clothing, books, and more. The goal is to create a simple and affordable marketplace for students to easily meet their needs as well as reduce the waste produced by many universities at the end of the term.
