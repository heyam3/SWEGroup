Dormify is a platform specifically marketed towards college students to buy and sell used items you typically find in a dorm such as appliances, clothing, books, and more. The goal is to create a simple and affordable marketplace for students to easily meet their needs as well as reduce the waste produced by many universities at the end of the term.

# What was achieved

1. Hasing of the users passwords
2. Create users
3. Developed backend
4. Created an accessable UI
5. Made Database
6. Successfuly created API's

Clicking on the main page index.html allows you to navigate through the website. Unfortunately, although backend was developed, integration and communication between backend and front end has could not be facilitated despite efforts.
